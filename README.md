# Music Advisor

## Some info

This is a personal music advisor that makes preference-based suggestions and even shares links to new releases and featured playlists. Together with Spotify, your music advisor will be a powerful guide to the world of music.\
It is one of the [hyperskill's] projects that was made to learn how to work with spotify's API.
